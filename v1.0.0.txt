- Changed !premier to only show stats from last 30 matches to align with !faceit command.
- Community bans no longer count towards total cheaters in !cheaters command
- Added AVG KR to !premier command

- You can now run !elo, !faceit, !cheaters, !premier in any channel the bot is in to see someone stats outside of their chat. (ex: !premier JojoDJ)

### **FIXES**
- Fixed issue with the bot not responding to commands randomly.
- Fixed a bug with calucation of ranks between competetive and premier matches.
- Fixed issue with !premier showing to low kill/death and KD value
- Will now respond to both upper & lower case commands.
- Commands now checks if the person trying to lookup starts with @, if it does it strips it. So both !elo JoJoDJ and !elo @JoJODJ works.
- Fixed NaN issue with KD on !premier command

### **DISCORD SERVER**
- Changed daily-highlight to daily-shoutout and updated the posted message to exclude highlight link.
- Added time to daily shoutout, making sure people are not shouted out within the same few days, making it possible for more to get a shoutout.
